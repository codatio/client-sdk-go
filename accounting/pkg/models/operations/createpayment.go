// >  In Codat, payments represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable, see [bill payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillPayment). These include [bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) and credit notes against bills.

//
// ## Overview
//
// Payments include all accounts receivable transaction data. This includes [invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice) and [credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote).
//
// A payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts receivable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to:
//
// - A payment made against an invoice, like a credit card, cheque, or cash payment.
// - An allocation of a customer's credit note, either to an invoice or maybe a refund.
// - A payment made directly to that accounts receivable account. This might be an overpayment or a prepayment. It might also be the refund of a payment made directly to an accounts receivable account.
//
// Depending on the payments allowed by the underlying accounting package, some payment types may be combined. Please see the [Example data](#section-example-data) below for more details.
//
// In Codat, a payment contains details of:
//
// - When the payment was recorded in the accounting system.
// - How much it is for and in what currency that amount is in.
// - Who the payment was _paid by_ – the _customer_.
// - The payment method used.
// - The breakdown of the types of payments – the _line items_.
//
// Payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).
//
// ## Payment types
//
// ## Payment of an invoice
//
// A payment paying a single invoice has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An _amount_ that indicates the amount of the invoice that was paid. This is always positive.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
//   - An **amount** for the link. The sum of the **line.amount** and the **links.amount** must equal `0`.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Payment of multiple invoices
//
// A single payment can pay multiple invoices. This can be represented in one of two formats depending on how the customer keeps their books:
//
// - The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each invoice that is paid. Each line follows the example and rules described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice).
// - The payment has a line with multiple links to each invoice. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each invoice is not available.
//
// Each **line** has the same properties as those described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice), with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment was allocated to the invoice. The sum of line amounts equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Payments and refunds on account
//
// A payment on account, that is a payment that doesn’t pay a specific invoice, has one entry in its lines array. The **line** has the following properties:
//
// - A **totalAmount** that indicates the amount paid by a customer or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the customer is always negative. A refund is always positive.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
// - A **type** that indicates the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
// - The **id** containing the ID of the customer.
// - The **amount** for the link is `0` – the **totalAmount** _or_ the amount of the payment or refund.
//
// It is possible to have a payment that is part _on account_ and part _allocated_ to an invoice. Each line should follow the examples above.
//
// ## Using a credit note to pay an invoice
//
// The payment of an invoice using a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and invoice allocation must balance each other.
// - A **links** array containing two elements:
//   - The first **link** has:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
//   - The second **link** has:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note used by this payment.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Refunding a credit note
//
// A payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative for a refund.
// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note that was refunded.
//
// The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the **amount** field of the **line**. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.
//
// ## Refunding a payment
//
// If a payment is refunded, for example, if a customer overpaid an invoice and the overpayment is returned to the customer, there are two payment records:
//
// - One for the incoming over payment.
// - Another for the outgoing refund.
//
// The payment issuing the refund has a negative **totalAmount**. This payment also has one entry in its lines array with the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Payment`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that was refunded.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.
//
// The payment that was refunded has a line where the **amount** is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was used to partly pay an invoice.
//
// For example: A £1,050 payment on a £1,000 invoice with a refund of £50 has two lines:
//
// - One for £1,000 linked to the invoice that was paid.
// - Another for £50 linked to the payment that refunded the overpayment with a** type** of `Refund` and an ID that corresponds to the payment.
//
// The **line** linked to the payment has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts receivable. It's balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Refund`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that refunded this line.
//
// > 📘 Support for linked payments
// >
// > Not all accounting packages support linking payments in this way. In some platforms, you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.
//
// ## Foreign currencies
//
// There are two types of currency rate that are included in the payments data type:
//
// Payment currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the accounts receivable account.
// - Foreign currency of the payment.
//
// Payment line link currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the item the link represents.
// - Foreign currency of the payment.
//
// These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a payment is applied to an item in a currency that doesn't match either:
//
// - The base currency for the accounts receivable account.
// - The currency of the item.
//

	// Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.
	//
	// Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
	//
	// Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
	//
	// For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.

//
// ## Overview
//
// Payments include all accounts receivable transaction data. This includes [invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice) and [credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote).
//
// A payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts receivable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to:
//
// - A payment made against an invoice, like a credit card, cheque, or cash payment.
// - An allocation of a customer's credit note, either to an invoice or maybe a refund.
// - A payment made directly to that accounts receivable account. This might be an overpayment or a prepayment. It might also be the refund of a payment made directly to an accounts receivable account.
//
// Depending on the payments allowed by the underlying accounting package, some payment types may be combined. Please see the [Example data](#section-example-data) below for more details.
//
// In Codat, a payment contains details of:
//
// - When the payment was recorded in the accounting system.
// - How much it is for and in what currency that amount is in.
// - Who the payment was _paid by_ – the _customer_.
// - The payment method used.
// - The breakdown of the types of payments – the _line items_.
//
// Payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).
//
// ## Payment types
//
// ## Payment of an invoice
//
// A payment paying a single invoice has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An _amount_ that indicates the amount of the invoice that was paid. This is always positive.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
//   - An **amount** for the link. The sum of the **line.amount** and the **links.amount** must equal `0`.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Payment of multiple invoices
//
// A single payment can pay multiple invoices. This can be represented in one of two formats depending on how the customer keeps their books:
//
// - The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each invoice that is paid. Each line follows the example and rules described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice).
// - The payment has a line with multiple links to each invoice. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each invoice is not available.
//
// Each **line** has the same properties as those described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice), with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment was allocated to the invoice. The sum of line amounts equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Payments and refunds on account
//
// A payment on account, that is a payment that doesn’t pay a specific invoice, has one entry in its lines array. The **line** has the following properties:
//
// - A **totalAmount** that indicates the amount paid by a customer or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the customer is always negative. A refund is always positive.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
// - A **type** that indicates the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
// - The **id** containing the ID of the customer.
// - The **amount** for the link is `0` – the **totalAmount** _or_ the amount of the payment or refund.
//
// It is possible to have a payment that is part _on account_ and part _allocated_ to an invoice. Each line should follow the examples above.
//
// ## Using a credit note to pay an invoice
//
// The payment of an invoice using a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and invoice allocation must balance each other.
// - A **links** array containing two elements:
//   - The first **link** has:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
//   - The second **link** has:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note used by this payment.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Refunding a credit note
//
// A payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative for a refund.
// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note that was refunded.
//
// The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the **amount** field of the **line**. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.
//
// ## Refunding a payment
//
// If a payment is refunded, for example, if a customer overpaid an invoice and the overpayment is returned to the customer, there are two payment records:
//
// - One for the incoming over payment.
// - Another for the outgoing refund.
//
// The payment issuing the refund has a negative **totalAmount**. This payment also has one entry in its lines array with the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Payment`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that was refunded.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.
//
// The payment that was refunded has a line where the **amount** is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was used to partly pay an invoice.
//
// For example: A £1,050 payment on a £1,000 invoice with a refund of £50 has two lines:
//
// - One for £1,000 linked to the invoice that was paid.
// - Another for £50 linked to the payment that refunded the overpayment with a** type** of `Refund` and an ID that corresponds to the payment.
//
// The **line** linked to the payment has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts receivable. It's balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Refund`.
//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that refunded this line.
//
// > 📘 Support for linked payments
// >
// > Not all accounting packages support linking payments in this way. In some platforms, you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.
//
// ## Foreign currencies
//
// There are two types of currency rate that are included in the payments data type:
//
// Payment currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the accounts receivable account.
// - Foreign currency of the payment.
//
// Payment line link currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the item the link represents.
// - Foreign currency of the payment.
//
// These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a payment is applied to an item in a currency that doesn't match either:
//
// - The base currency for the accounts receivable account.
// - The currency of the item.
//
// ```json Currency rate example

	//
	// ## Overview
	//
	// Payments include all accounts receivable transaction data. This includes [invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice) and [credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote).
	//
	// A payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts receivable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to:
	//
	// - A payment made against an invoice, like a credit card, cheque, or cash payment.
	// - An allocation of a customer's credit note, either to an invoice or maybe a refund.
	// - A payment made directly to that accounts receivable account. This might be an overpayment or a prepayment. It might also be the refund of a payment made directly to an accounts receivable account.
	//
	// Depending on the payments allowed by the underlying accounting package, some payment types may be combined. Please see the [Example data](#section-example-data) below for more details.
	//
	// In Codat, a payment contains details of:
	//
	// - When the payment was recorded in the accounting system.
	// - How much it is for and in what currency that amount is in.
	// - Who the payment was _paid by_ – the _customer_.
	// - The payment method used.
	// - The breakdown of the types of payments – the _line items_.
	//
	// Payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).
	//
	// ## Payment types
	//
	// ## Payment of an invoice
	//
	// A payment paying a single invoice has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:
	//
	// - An _amount_ that indicates the amount of the invoice that was paid. This is always positive.
	// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
	//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
	//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
	//   - An **amount** for the link. The sum of the **line.amount** and the **links.amount** must equal `0`.
	//
	// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
	//
	// ## Payment of multiple invoices
	//
	// A single payment can pay multiple invoices. This can be represented in one of two formats depending on how the customer keeps their books:
	//
	// - The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each invoice that is paid. Each line follows the example and rules described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice).
	// - The payment has a line with multiple links to each invoice. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each invoice is not available.
	//
	// Each **line** has the same properties as those described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice), with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment was allocated to the invoice. The sum of line amounts equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
	//
	// ## Payments and refunds on account
	//
	// A payment on account, that is a payment that doesn’t pay a specific invoice, has one entry in its lines array. The **line** has the following properties:
	//
	// - A **totalAmount** that indicates the amount paid by a customer or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the customer is always negative. A refund is always positive.
	// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
	// - A **type** that indicates the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
	// - The **id** containing the ID of the customer.
	// - The **amount** for the link is `0` – the **totalAmount** _or_ the amount of the payment or refund.
	//
	// It is possible to have a payment that is part _on account_ and part _allocated_ to an invoice. Each line should follow the examples above.
	//
	// ## Using a credit note to pay an invoice
	//
	// The payment of an invoice using a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:
	//
	// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and invoice allocation must balance each other.
	// - A **links** array containing two elements:
	//   - The first **link** has:
	//     - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
	//     - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
	//   - The second **link** has:
	//     - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
	//     - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note used by this payment.
	//
	// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
	//
	// ## Refunding a credit note
	//
	// A payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:
	//
	// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative for a refund.
	// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
	//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
	//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note that was refunded.
	//
	// The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the **amount** field of the **line**. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.
	//
	// ## Refunding a payment
	//
	// If a payment is refunded, for example, if a customer overpaid an invoice and the overpayment is returned to the customer, there are two payment records:
	//
	// - One for the incoming over payment.
	// - Another for the outgoing refund.
	//
	// The payment issuing the refund has a negative **totalAmount**. This payment also has one entry in its lines array with the following properties:
	//
	// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
	// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
	//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Payment`.
	//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that was refunded.
	//
	// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.
	//
	// The payment that was refunded has a line where the **amount** is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was used to partly pay an invoice.
	//
	// For example: A £1,050 payment on a £1,000 invoice with a refund of £50 has two lines:
	//
	// - One for £1,000 linked to the invoice that was paid.
	// - Another for £50 linked to the payment that refunded the overpayment with a** type** of `Refund` and an ID that corresponds to the payment.
	//
	// The **line** linked to the payment has the following properties:
	//
	// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts receivable. It's balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
	// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
	//   - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Refund`.
	//   - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that refunded this line.
	//
	// > 📘 Support for linked payments
	// >
	// > Not all accounting packages support linking payments in this way. In some platforms, you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.
	//
	// ## Foreign currencies
	//
	// There are two types of currency rate that are included in the payments data type:
	//
	// Payment currency rate:
	//
	// - Base currency of the accounts receivable account.
	// - Foreign currency of the payment.
	//
	// Payment line link currency rate:
	//
	// - Base currency of the item the link represents.
	// - Foreign currency of the payment.
	//
	// These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a payment is applied to an item in a currency that doesn't match either:
	//
	// - The base currency for the accounts receivable account.
	// - The currency of the item.
	//

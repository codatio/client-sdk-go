// > In Codat, bill payments represent accounts payable only. For accounts receivable, see [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment), which includes [invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice) and [credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote).
//
// > View the coverage for bill payments in the <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/accounting?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=billPayments" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.
//
// ## Overview
//
// Bill payments include all accounts payable transaction data. This includes [bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) and [credit notes against bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillCreditNote).
//
// A bill payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts payable account. This includes but is not strictly limited to:
//
// - A payment made against a billâ€”for example, a credit card payment, cheque payment, or cash payment.
// - An allocation of a supplier's credit note, to a bill or perhaps a refund.
// - A bill payment made directly to an accounts payable account. This could be an overpayment or a prepayment, or a refund of a payment made directly to an accounts payable account.
//
// Depending on the bill payments which are allowed by the underlying accounting package, some of these types may be combined. Please see the [Example data](#example-data) section for samples of what these cases look like.
//
// In Codat, a bill payment contains details of:
//
// - When the bill payment was recorded in the accounting system.
// - How much it is for and in the currency.
// - Who the payment has been paid to, the _supplier_.
// - The types of bill payments, the _line items_.
//
// Some accounting platforms give a separate name to purchases where the payment is made immediately, such as something bought with a credit card or online payment. One example of this would be QuickBooks Online's _expenses_. You can find these types of transactions in our [Direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost) data model.
//
// Bill payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).
//
// ---
//
// ## Bill payment types
//
// ## Payment of a bill
//
// A payment paying a single bill should have the following properties:
//
// - A `totalAmount` indicating the amount of the bill that was paid. This is always positive.
// - A `lines` array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - An `amount` equal to the `totalAmount` above.
//   - A `links` array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A `type` indicating the type of link, in this case a `Bill`.
//   - An `id` containing the ID of the bill that was paid.
//   - An amount of `-totalAmount` (negative `totalAmount`), indicating that the entirety of the paid amount is allocated to the bill.
//
// ## Payment of multiple bills
//
// It is possible for one payment to pay multiple bills. This can be represented using two possible formats, depending on how the supplier keeps their books:
//
// 1. The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each bill that is paid. Each line will follow the above example for paying a bill, and the rules detailed in the data model.
// 2. The payment has a line with multiple links to each bill. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each bill is not available.
//
// Each line is the same as those described above, with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment is allocated to the bill. The **amount** on the lines sum to the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// > ðŸš§ Pushing batch payments to Xero
// >
// > When pushing a single bill payment to Xero to pay multiple bills, only the first format is supportedâ€”multiple entries in the payment **lines** array.
//
// ## Payments and refunds on account
//
// A payment on account, that is a payment that doesnâ€™t pay a specific bill, has one entry in its lines array.
//
// The line has the following properties:
//
// - A **totalAmount** indicating the amount paid by a supplier or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the supplier is always negative. A refund is always positive.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
//   - The **id** containing the ID of the supplier.
//   - An amount for the link is `0` **totalAmount** or the amount of the payment or refund.
//
// It is possible to have a payment that is part on account and part allocated to a bill. Each line should follow the examples above.
//
// ## Using a credit note to pay a bill
//
// The payment of a bill using a credit note has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and bill allocation must balance each other.
// - A **links** array containing two elements:
//   - The first link has:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of link, in this case a `Bill`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the bill that was paid.
//   - The second link has:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of link, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note used by this payment.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Refunding a credit note
//
// A bill payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This line has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative, indicating that it is a refund.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of `link`, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note that was refunded.
//
// The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the line's **amount** field. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts payable.
//
// ## Refunding a payment
//
// If a payment is refunded, for example, when a company overpaid a bill and the overpayment is returned, there are two payment records:
//
// - One for the incoming overpayment.
// - Another for the outgoing refund.
//
// The payment issuing the refund is identified by the fact that the **totalAmount** is negative. This payment has one entry in its lines array that have the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of a the link, in this case a `BillPayment`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the payment that was refunded.
//
// The **amount** field on the line equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative as this is money leaving accounts payable.
//
// The payment that was refunded can be identified as it has a line where the `amount` on its `line` is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was partly used to pay an bill. For example, a Â£1,050 payment paying a Â£1,000 bill with a refund of Â£50 has two lines:
//
// - One for Â£1,000 linked to the bill that was paid
// - Another for Â£50 linked to the payment that refunded the over payment. This link is of type `Refund` but the ID corresponds to a bill payment.
//
// The line linked to the bill payment has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts payable, but is balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of the link, in this case a `Refund`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the payment that refunded this line.
//
// > ðŸ“˜ Linked payments
// >
// > Not all accounting packages support linked payments in this way. In these platforms you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.
//
// ## Foreign currencies
//
// There are two types of currency rate that are detailed in the bill payments data type:
//
// Payment currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the accounts payable account.
// - Foreign currency of the bill payment.
//
// Payment line link currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the item that the link represents.
// - Foreign currency of the payment.
//
// These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a bill payment is applied to an item in a currency that does not match either:
//
// - The base currency for the accounts payable account.
// - The currency of the item.

//
// ## Overview
//
// Bill payments include all accounts payable transaction data. This includes [bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) and [credit notes against bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillCreditNote).
//
// A bill payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts payable account. This includes but is not strictly limited to:
//
// - A payment made against a billâ€”for example, a credit card payment, cheque payment, or cash payment.
// - An allocation of a supplier's credit note, to a bill or perhaps a refund.
// - A bill payment made directly to an accounts payable account. This could be an overpayment or a prepayment, or a refund of a payment made directly to an accounts payable account.
//
// Depending on the bill payments which are allowed by the underlying accounting package, some of these types may be combined. Please see the [Example data](#example-data) section for samples of what these cases look like.
//
// In Codat, a bill payment contains details of:
//
// - When the bill payment was recorded in the accounting system.
// - How much it is for and in the currency.
// - Who the payment has been paid to, the _supplier_.
// - The types of bill payments, the _line items_.
//
// Some accounting platforms give a separate name to purchases where the payment is made immediately, such as something bought with a credit card or online payment. One example of this would be QuickBooks Online's _expenses_. You can find these types of transactions in our [Direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost) data model.
//
// Bill payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).
//
// ---
//
// ## Bill payment types
//
// ## Payment of a bill
//
// A payment paying a single bill should have the following properties:
//
// - A `totalAmount` indicating the amount of the bill that was paid. This is always positive.
// - A `lines` array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - An `amount` equal to the `totalAmount` above.
//   - A `links` array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A `type` indicating the type of link, in this case a `Bill`.
//   - An `id` containing the ID of the bill that was paid.
//   - An amount of `-totalAmount` (negative `totalAmount`), indicating that the entirety of the paid amount is allocated to the bill.
//
// ## Payment of multiple bills
//
// It is possible for one payment to pay multiple bills. This can be represented using two possible formats, depending on how the supplier keeps their books:
//
// 1. The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each bill that is paid. Each line will follow the above example for paying a bill, and the rules detailed in the data model.
// 2. The payment has a line with multiple links to each bill. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each bill is not available.
//
// Each line is the same as those described above, with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment is allocated to the bill. The **amount** on the lines sum to the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// > ðŸš§ Pushing batch payments to Xero
// >
// > When pushing a single bill payment to Xero to pay multiple bills, only the first format is supportedâ€”multiple entries in the payment **lines** array.
//
// ## Payments and refunds on account
//
// A payment on account, that is a payment that doesnâ€™t pay a specific bill, has one entry in its lines array.
//
// The line has the following properties:
//
// - A **totalAmount** indicating the amount paid by a supplier or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the supplier is always negative. A refund is always positive.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
//   - The **id** containing the ID of the supplier.
//   - An amount for the link is `0` **totalAmount** or the amount of the payment or refund.
//
// It is possible to have a payment that is part on account and part allocated to a bill. Each line should follow the examples above.
//
// ## Using a credit note to pay a bill
//
// The payment of a bill using a credit note has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and bill allocation must balance each other.
// - A **links** array containing two elements:
//   - The first link has:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of link, in this case a `Bill`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the bill that was paid.
//   - The second link has:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of link, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note used by this payment.
//
// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
//
// ## Refunding a credit note
//
// A bill payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This line has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative, indicating that it is a refund.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of `link`, in this case a `CreditNote`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note that was refunded.
//
// The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the line's **amount** field. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts payable.
//
// ## Refunding a payment
//
// If a payment is refunded, for example, when a company overpaid a bill and the overpayment is returned, there are two payment records:
//
// - One for the incoming overpayment.
// - Another for the outgoing refund.
//
// The payment issuing the refund is identified by the fact that the **totalAmount** is negative. This payment has one entry in its lines array that have the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of a the link, in this case a `BillPayment`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the payment that was refunded.
//
// The **amount** field on the line equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative as this is money leaving accounts payable.
//
// The payment that was refunded can be identified as it has a line where the `amount` on its `line` is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was partly used to pay an bill. For example, a Â£1,050 payment paying a Â£1,000 bill with a refund of Â£50 has two lines:
//
// - One for Â£1,000 linked to the bill that was paid
// - Another for Â£50 linked to the payment that refunded the over payment. This link is of type `Refund` but the ID corresponds to a bill payment.
//
// The line linked to the bill payment has the following properties:
//
// - An **amount** indicating the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts payable, but is balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
//   - A **type** indicating the type of the link, in this case a `Refund`.
//   - An **id** containing the ID of the payment that refunded this line.
//
// > ðŸ“˜ Linked payments
// >
// > Not all accounting packages support linked payments in this way. In these platforms you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.
//
// ## Foreign currencies
//
// There are two types of currency rate that are detailed in the bill payments data type:
//
// Payment currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the accounts payable account.
// - Foreign currency of the bill payment.
//
// Payment line link currency rate:
//
// - Base currency of the item that the link represents.
// - Foreign currency of the payment.
//
// These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a bill payment is applied to an item in a currency that does not match either:
//
// - The base currency for the accounts payable account.
// - The currency of the item.

	// Account the payment is linked to in the accounting platform.
	AccountRef *CreateBillPayment200ApplicationJSONSourceModifiedDateAccountRef `json:"accountRef,omitempty"`
	// ISO currency code in which the bill payment is recorded in the accounting platform.
	Currency *string `json:"currency,omitempty"`
	// Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.
	//
	// Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
	//
	// Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
	//
	// For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.

	//     - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note used by this payment.
	//
	// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.
	//
	// ## Refunding a credit note
	//
	// A bill payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This line has the following properties:
	//
	// - An **amount** indicating the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative, indicating that it is a refund.

	//
	// If a payment is refunded, for example, when a company overpaid a bill and the overpayment is returned, there are two payment records:
	//
	// - One for the incoming overpayment.
	// - Another for the outgoing refund.
	//
	// The payment issuing the refund is identified by the fact that the **totalAmount** is negative. This payment has one entry in its lines array that have the following properties:

	// The payment that was refunded can be identified as it has a line where the `amount` on its `line` is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`.

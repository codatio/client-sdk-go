// > We distinguish between invoices where the company *owes money* vs. *is owed money*. If the company issued an invoice, and is owed money (accounts receivable) we call this an Invoice.
// >
// > See [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) for the accounts payable equivalent of bills.

//
// ## Overview
//
// An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).
//
// In Codat, an invoice contains details of:
//
// - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
// - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
// - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
// - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
// - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.

//
// > **Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks**
// >
// > In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.

	AdditionalTaxAmount     *float64 `json:"additionalTaxAmount,omitempty"`

	// Amount outstanding on the invoice.
	AmountDue float64 `json:"amountDue"`
	// The currency data type in Codat is the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code, e.g. _GBP_.
	//
	// ## Unknown currencies
	//
	// In line with the ISO 4217 specification, the code _XXX_ is used when the data source does not return a currency for a transaction.
	//
	// There are only a very small number of edge cases where this currency code is returned by the Codat system.
	Currency *string `json:"currency,omitempty"`
	// Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.
	//
	// Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
	//
	// Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
	//
	// For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
	//
	// ## Examples with base currency of GBP
	//
	// | Foreign Currency | Foreign Amount | Currency Rate | Base Currency Amount (GBP) |
	// | :--------------- | :------------- | :------------ | :------------------------- |
	// | **USD**          | $20            | 0.781         | £15.62                     |

	// - `PartiallyPaid` - The balance paid against the invoice is positive, but less than the total invoice amount (0 < amountDue < totalAmount).
	// - `Paid` - Invoice is paid in full. This includes if the invoice has been credited or overpaid (amountDue == 0).
	// - `Void` - An invoice can become Void when it's deleted, refunded, written off, or cancelled. A voided invoice may still be PartiallyPaid, and so all outstanding amounts on voided invoices are removed from the accounts receivable account.

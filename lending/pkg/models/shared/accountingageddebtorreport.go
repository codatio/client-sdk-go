// AccountingAgedDebtorReport - The Aged Debtors report shows the total outstanding balance due from customers to the business over time.
//
// You can generate it for a company based on recently synced data from your customers' accounting platforms. The report is available in the **Reports** tab in the Codat portal.
//
// Total assets or liabilities are grouped into 30-day periods for each customer, up to the current date. You can adjust the report date, period length, and number of periods to show on each report. The data can be grouped by customer or currency.
//
// > It is not guaranteed that write-offs are included in the Aged Debtors report.
//
// ## Underlying data
//
// The Aged Debtors report is generated from a set of required data types: [Customers](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer), [Invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice), [Credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote), and [Payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment).
//
// To generate the report, the underlying data types must have been synced within 24 hours of each other. Otherwise an error is displayed when you try to run the report. Sync the required data types by clicking the link in the error, and then run the report again.
//
// > The Aged Debtors report runs based on the **issue dates** of the underlying data types rather than the due date.
//

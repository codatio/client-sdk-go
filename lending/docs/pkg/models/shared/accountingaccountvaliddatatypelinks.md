# AccountingAccountValidDataTypeLinks

When querying Codat's data model, some data types return `validDatatypeLinks` metadata in the JSON response. This indicates where that object can be used as a reference—a _valid link_—when creating or updating other data.

For example, `validDatatypeLinks` might indicate the following references:

- Which tax rates are valid to use on the line item of a bill.
- Which items can be used when creating an invoice. 

You can use `validDatatypeLinks` to present your SMB customers with only valid choices when selecting objects from a list, for example.

## `validDatatypeLinks` example

The following example uses the `Accounting.Accounts` data type. It shows that, on the linked integration, this account is valid as the account on a payment or bill payment; and as the account referenced on the line item of a direct income or direct cost. Because there is no valid link to Invoices or Bills, using this account on those data types will result in an error.

```json validDatatypeLinks for an account
{
            "id": "bd9e85e0-0478-433d-ae9f-0b3c4f04bfe4",
            "nominalCode": "090",
            "name": "Business Bank Account",
            #...
            "validDatatypeLinks": [
                {
                    "property": "Id",
                    "links": [
                        "Payment.AccountRef.Id",
                        "BillPayment.AccountRef.Id",
                        "DirectIncome.LineItems.AccountRef.Id",
                        "DirectCost.LineItems.AccountRef.Id"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
```

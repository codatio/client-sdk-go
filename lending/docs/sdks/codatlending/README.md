## Overview

Lending API: Our Lending API helps you make smarter credit decisions on small businesses by enabling you to pull your customers' latest data from accounting, banking, and commerce platforms they are already using. It also includes features to help providers verify the accuracy of data and process it more efficiently.

The Lending API is built on top of the latest accounting, commerce, and banking data, providing you with the most important data points you need to get a full picture of SMB creditworthiness and make a comprehensive assessment of your customers.
